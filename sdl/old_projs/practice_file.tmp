It is Sunday morning. I hear our dial-up modem playing bad jazz as my mother
connects to the internet. I am in       the bathroom. I recently discovered that my
mother has been typing the names o      f as-yet-uninvented mental conditions into
Yahoo’s search engine: ‘delusion s      yndrome teenage’, ‘over-active imagination
problem’, ‘holistic behavioural st      abilizers’. When you type ‘delusion syndrome
teenage’ into Yahoo, the first ( fjefb ehfhe  lo o o) { { { }    } { } } page
it offers you is to do with Cotard’s Syndrome. Cotard’s Syndrome is a branch of

autism where people believe they are dead. The website features some choice
quotes from victims of the disease. For a while I was slipping these phrases
into lulls in conversation at dinnertime or when my mother asked about my day
at school. ‘My body has been replaced by a shell.’ ‘My internal organs are made
of stone.’ ‘I have been dead for years.’ I have stopped saying these things.
The more I pretended to be a corpse, the less open she became about issues of
mental health. I used to write questionnaires for my parents. I wanted to get
to know them better. I asked things like: What hereditary illnesses am I likely
to inherit? What money and land am I likely to inherit? If your child was
adopted, at what age would you choose to tell him about his real mother? a) 4–8
b) 9–14 c) 15–18 I am nearly fifteen. They looked over the questionnaires but
they never answered them. Since then, I have been using covert analysis to
discover my parents’ secrets. One of the things I have discovered is that,
although my father’s beard looks ginger from a distance, when you get up close
it is in fact a subtle blend of black, blond and strawberry. I have also learnt
that my parents have not had sex in two months. I monitor their intimacy via
the dimmer switch in their bedroom. I know when they have been at it because
the next morning the dial will still be set to halfway. I also discovered that
my father suffers from bouts of depression: I found an empty bottle of
tricyclic antidepressants that were in the wicker bin under his bedside table.
I still have the bottle among my old Transformers. Depression comes in bouts.
Like boxing. Dad is in the blue corner. It takes all of my intuition to find
out when a bout of my father’s depression has started. Here are two signals:
one, I can hear him emptying the dishwasher from my attic room. Two, he presses
so hard when he handwrites that it is possible, in a certain light, to see two
or three days’ worth of notes indented in the surface of our plastic easy-
clean tablecloth
