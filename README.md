using the SDL2 library, the text editor is created using my own custom font and font format which reads in the raw binary and creates a pixel array for each character.
then, the pixels are drawn to the screen in a uniform manor as text is inputted
still a work in progess, not finished!
kinda needs a full rewrite lowkey haha
